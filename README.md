Reposity for "Assessing functional redundancy in Eurasian small mammal assemblages across multiple traits and biogeographic extents"
Functional redundancy (FR) is commonly invoked as one of the main mechanisms
underlying ecological resilience. However, little is known about the extension of FR
from single to multiple functions and its variation among ecological assemblages at biogeographic
scales. We studied 51 assemblages of Eurasian small mammals (Mammalia:
Rodentia and Mammalia: Soricomorpha), analyzing FR across and within assemblages.
We quantified FR for trait sets related to five different functions: parasitic interactions,
diet, habitat preferences, body mass and diel activity. We then evaluated the relationships
between FR based on different functional trait sets across and within mammal
assemblages, to determine whether small mammal assemblages and their species are
redundant for single or multiple trait sets and thus, whether they are complementary
or fully redundant when considering multiple functions. Further, we analyzed
the influence of geography, climate, plant productivity and land use on FR. We found
that FR based on mammal parasitic interactions, body mass and diel activity were
positively correlated, whereas FR based on mammal body mass and habitat preferences
were negatively related. These relationships were consistent across and within mammal
assemblages. Additionally, FR mainly varied along geographic gradients (latitude and
longitude). FR based on parasitic interactions, body mass and diel activity followed
similar patterns, increasing at northern latitudes, possibly as a response to environmental
filtering processes. FR for diet and habitat preferences increased at easterly
longitudes, which may be due to landscape homogeneity in sites across central and
eastern Asia. Despite redundancy across multiple functional trait sets, Eurasian small
mammal assemblages were complementary when considering all five trait sets. Our
results warn against conclusions drawn from the study of FR based on traits related to
a single function.
